# 🤖 AI Project Collection

Welcome to a showcase of ** AI applications** — ranging from real-time object detection to medical image classification, built with Python, TensorFlow, and cutting-edge computer vision libraries.  

> 🚀 Each project is standalone, modular, and demo-ready — designed to run efficiently on edge devices like **phyBOARD-Pollux i.MX 8M Plus**.

## 🧭 Target Platform: phyBOARD-Pollux (i.MX 8M Plus)

This repository is **optimized for deployment** on the NXP-based **phyBOARD-Pollux i.MX 8M Plus** board:

- ✅ Uses TFLite quantized models compatible with **NPU acceleration**
- ✅ Tailored for real-time inference on embedded systems and edge devices
- ✅ Supports NPU acceleration using libvx_delegate.so, with compatibility for TFLite int8 models.

> 🧠 All models have been tested or designed for **real-time edge inference** on the i.MX8MP using **TensorFlow Lite + NPU**.
